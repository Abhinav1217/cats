For CATS to become a fullblown IDE, many features still need to be implemented. A short list of things planned in the next releases:

- Introduce basic refactoring support.
- Improve file IO (like auto refresh, adding files, ...).
- Version control support (at least support Git somehow).
- Implement incremental updates to speedup automcomplete of very large projects.
- Improve autocomplete viewer for large completion sets.

I'm sure I forgot many things to mention on this list. Please let me know if you know a cool feature that you think should be included.
