CATS is opensource and runs on Linux, Windows and OSX. CATS itself is written in TypeScript.\r\n\r\nAlthough not yet feature complete, it is getting there. Right now CATS already has built-in suppor\r\nt for the following features:\r\n\r\n- Code completion (just type a dot or Ctrl-Space to invoke it).\r\n                       \r\n- Syntax highlighting (and not only for TypeScript).\r\n\r\n- Validation of the source code (running in the background) informing you of compiler warnings and errors.\r\n\r\n- Various editing features like folding, indentation (see also help => keyboard shortcuts to see a list).\r\n\r\n- Compilation, both to a single file or to multiple files.\r\n\r\n- Running the code from the IDE.\r\n\r\n- Theme support:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jbaron/cats/master/artifacts/themes.jpg\" height=\"250px\" width=\"850px\" />\r\n\r\nIt is strongly encouraged to first make a backup before using CATS on your project since the software is still considered to be of alpha quality. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation & Running it\r\n=========================\r\nTo install CATS, just follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download the CATS from Github: \r\n\r\n        \t\tgit clone https://github.com/jbaron/cats.git\r\n\r\n2. Download and install node-webkit. In case you don't have node-webkit yet, you can download a binary for Windows, Linux or Mac at:\r\n     \r\n     \t\t\thttps://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Go to the cats directory and type: /path_to_node_webkit/nw ./\r\n\r\nBy default the \"greeter\" project will be loaded. In the samples directory there are several other projects you can try out. Of course when you open a new project, you can also open a directory that contains your own project.\r\n   \r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\nCATS will look for a file in the project directory called: \".settings/config.json\". If found, CATS will use the values configured in this file, otherwise it will use sensible default values.\r\n\r\nYou can edit this file (or the default values if you don't have this file yet) from the main menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs and Issues\r\n===============\r\nIn case you encounter an issue, you can open a ticket on Github. Also feature requests can be entered here:\r\n\r\n\t\t      https://github.com/jbaron/cats/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding from source\r\n=====================\r\nThere is no need to compile CATS yourself, since all the compiled files are already included. But if you want to play aorund with it, here are the steps:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have installed TypeScript 0.8.1 or later\r\n\r\n2. Go to the cats directory\r\n\r\n3. The following will compile the required worker.js file:\r\n\r\n         tsc @build\r\n\r\n4. Now the only thing left is to compile the main.js file: \r\n\r\n\t\ttsc @build2\r\n   \r\n\r\nThat is all there is to it. The lib file should now have an updated main.js and worker.js file and you are ready to run CATS editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouldn't have done it without ....\r\n==================================\r\nSome of the main components that are being used by CATS:\r\n\r\n- ACE, an embeddable code editor written in JavaScript.\r\n- Typescipt 0.8.1 (of course).\r\n- Node-webkit. This is a great initiative of Intel to allow Node libraries to be used within a web page. We use this to read and write local files without the need for a server component.\r\n\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n=====\r\nSee the TODO.md file for details.\r\n","name":"CATS"}
