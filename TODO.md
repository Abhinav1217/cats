For CATS to become a fullblown editor, many features still need to be implemented. A short list of things planned in the next releases:

- Write the compiled files to file system.
- Introduce basic refactoring support.
- Version control support (at least support Git somehow).


I'm sure I forgot many things to mention on this list. Please let me know if you know a cool feature that you think should be included.
