For CATS to become a fullblown IDE, many features still need to be implemented. A short list of things planned to be included before release 1.0, ordered by their estimated effort:

Major effort
============
- Introduce refactoring support.
- Improve file handling (like auto refresh, adding files, etc).
- Version control support (at least support Git somehow).
- Add editing capabilities (better find & replace, formatting code, etc).

Average effort
==============
- Implement incremental updates to speedup autocomplete of large projects/files.
- Improve autocomplete viewer for large completion sets.
- Implement a fully functional tabbar.

Minor effort
============
- Create the declarations for ACE editor API (or at least part being used by CATS).
- Create the declarations for node-webkit API (or at least part being used by CATS).
- Add additional typing info to source code to improve compiler checking.
- Improve theme handling.
- Expose more editor configuration parameters like font size.

I'm sure I forgot many things to mention on this list. Please let me know if you know a cool feature that you think should be included.
